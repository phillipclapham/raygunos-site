It's a framework for working with how your brain actually functions rather than forcing productivity systems that fight against your nature. Built on neuroscience research, it treats mental frames as experiments rather than fixed truths, giving you choice at the moment between stimulus and response."

If you've tried GTD, Pomodoro, and other productivity systems only to feel like you're fighting yourself, RAYGUN offers a different approach. It's particularly resonant for people with ADHD, creatives, builders, and anyone who's most productive when tinkering and experimenting rather than executing rigid plans."

GTD asks you to capture and organize everything externally. Pomodoro forces artificial time boxes. RAYGUN instead teaches you to notice the gap between stimulus and response—the frame-selection point—and make conscious choices about how to engage. It's not about doing more; it's about being alive while you work."

Rather than fighting hyperfocus and distractibility, RAYGUN works with these traits. It treats fascination as fuel rather than distraction, and teaches you to notice when you're grinding versus experimenting. Many people with ADHD find RAYGUN describes how they already work at their best."

The difference is measurable: procrastination depletes energy and creates anxiety, while experiment-mode generates energy and produces results.

The core insight is that fascination is a choice—a frame for engaging with reality—not a property of the task. Boring administrative work becomes an experiment in efficiency. Difficult conversations become experiments in understanding. The constraint doesn't change; your relationship to it does."

The Troubleshooting page helps diagnose what might be happening—whether it's depletion (you're too exhausted for meta-awareness), technique (the loop isn't landing), habit (old patterns persist), or understanding (intellectual vs embodied knowledge).

                            <p><strong>GTD (Getting Things Done)</strong> is about external organization—capturing everything, processing it into lists, and executing from context-based task lists.</p>
                            <p><strong>RAYGUN</strong> is about internal orientation—how you relate to whatever you're facing, regardless of how it's organized.</p>
                            <p>Key differences:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>GTD assumes you'll execute if you organize right. RAYGUN addresses <em>why execution feels hard in the first place</em>.</li>
                                <li>GTD is task-management. RAYGUN is cognitive architecture.</li>
                                <li>GTD works great for some brains. RAYGUN is for brains that resist GTD's structure.</li>

                            <p><strong>Pomodoro</strong> uses time-boxing—work for 25 minutes, break for 5, repeat.</p>
                            <p><strong>RAYGUN</strong> doesn't impose artificial structure. It works with your natural attention cycles rather than forcing arbitrary intervals.</p>
                            <p>The problem with Pomodoro for some brains: it interrupts flow states. When you're deeply engaged, the timer breaks the spell. RAYGUN lets you ride fascination as long as it lasts.</p>
                            <p>Pomodoro can be useful when depleted (it's a constraint that reduces decision fatigue). But it's a tool, not an operating system.</p>

                            <p><strong>RAYGUN</strong> uses that awareness (meta-perception) as the foundation, then adds:</p>
