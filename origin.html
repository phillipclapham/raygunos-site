                        <p>I was born in 1980 with a brain that ran on fascination, not discipline.</p>

                        <p>Childhood was tinkering. Taking things apart to see how they worked. Getting lost in experiments for hours. Couldn't sit still through boring tasks but could hyperfocus on puzzles all day.</p>

                        <p>I thought I was broken.</p>

                        <p>In my 20s and 30s, I tried to fix myself. Productivity systems, discipline frameworks, morning routines, habit stacking. Read GTD cover to cover. Tried Pomodoro. Attempted to "eat the frog."</p>

                        <p>Failed spectacularly. Repeatedly. Hilariously.</p>

                        <p class="pull-quote">"I wasn't failing at discipline. I was succeeding at something else."</p>

                        <p>But I kept noticing something: Whenever I was tinkering, experimenting, playing with ideas—I could work for 12 hours and feel energized. The moment I tried to force discipline, everything ground to a halt.</p>

                        <p>I didn't understand WHY yet. I just kept experimenting because that's all my brain knew how to do.</p>

                        <p>In my 30s and early 40s, the pattern became impossible to ignore.</p>

                        <p>Years of failed productivity experiments + years of successful tinkering = data.</p>

                        <p>I started documenting what actually worked. Not what should work, not what the books said, but what my brain actually DID when it was functioning well.</p>

                        <p><strong>The pattern: Experimentation worked. Forcing never did.</strong></p>

                        <p>Then I found the neuroscience research backing it. Attention modulation. Cognitive flexibility. Frame-switching. Fascination-driven learning. Dopamine and curiosity loops.</p>

                        <p>Holy shit. There was a SYSTEM here. Not personality quirks. Not "just how I'm wired." But replicable cognitive architecture.</p>

                        <p>RAYGUN started emerging from 45 years of accidental data.</p>

                    <div class="narrative-text">
                        <p>Then everything accelerated in 2020.</p>

                        <p>I started getting diagnosed with serious health conditions. Multiple organ systems. Complex interactions. Doctors are still figuring out exact classifications and disagree on severity.</p>

                        <p>What I know for certain:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Mast cell disease (official diagnosis, still classifying exact type)</li>
                            <li>Kidney problems (progressing, not good)</li>
                            <li>Heart issues (documented but not fully specific)</li>
                            <li>Plus: asthma, blood pressure, GERD, IBS, and more</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>The mechanism that matters most:</strong> Anxiety triggers mast cell reactions. Mast cell reactions cause physical harm across multiple systems. The more stressed I got, the worse my body responded.</p>

                        <p class="pull-quote critical">"Stress wasn't just unpleasant. It was literally accelerating physical damage."</p>

                        <p>Everything became urgent.</p>

                        <p>If RAYGUN mattered—if this framework I'd been discovering could help others—I needed to build it NOW. Not someday. Not when it was perfect. Now.</p>

                        <p>Most people would grind through that diagnosis. Panic. Force solutions. Try harder.</p>

                        <p>I did the opposite.</p>

                        <p class="pull-quote">"Turns out mortality is just another constraint to experiment with."</p>

                        <p>I treated my own health—my own mortality—as the ultimate puzzle.</p>

                        <p>Started building:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Protocol Memory:</strong> Cognitive infrastructure for human-AI partnership</li>
                            <li><strong>FlowScript:</strong> Topographical language for high-bandwidth thinking</li>
                            <li><strong>RAYGUN:</strong> The complete framework you're reading now</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>And I noticed something extraordinary.</p>

                        <p>The more I experimented instead of grinding, the calmer I felt. Less anxiety meant fewer mast cell reactions. Fewer reactions meant less physical harm across all systems.</p>

                        <p><strong>The framework wasn't just helping me work. It was helping me survive. And it drove massive success in my life and career over the past 5 years.</strong></p>

                        <p>Has RAYGUN extended my life?</p>

                        <p><strong>I genuinely believe so.</strong></p>

                        <p>By how much? I don't know. All I know is:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>My stress levels dropped dramatically</li>
                            <li>My physical reactions decreased</li>
                            <li>My health stabilized instead of continuing to decline</li>
                            <li>I'm still here, still building, still experimenting</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>By staying in experiment mode—treating constraints as puzzles, running small tests, following fascination—I reduced the anxiety that was accelerating harm.</p>

                        <p class="pull-quote">"Every hour experimenting instead of grinding is an hour my body isn't attacking itself."</p>

                        <p>How much longer do I have? Could be years, could be decades. The medical reality is complex and uncertain.</p>

                        <p>But I know this: The framework keeping me calm is the same one I'm sharing with you.</p>

                        <p><strong>RAYGUN is both the methodology AND the proof. It's how I stay alive.</strong></p>

                        <p>I could keep this private. It's working for me.</p>

                        <p>But here's the thing:</p>

                        <p>If treating your constraints as experiments can help someone manage serious health conditions, imagine what it can do for burnout. For stress. For depression. For whatever's grinding you down.</p>

                        <p>My constraints are mast cell disease, kidney problems, heart issues. Yours might be different.</p>

                        <p><strong>But the principle is the same: Experiment with what's constraining you instead of grinding against it.</strong></p>

                        <p>I built RAYGUN to stay functional while managing serious health realities. It worked.</p>

                        <p>Now I'm sharing it not because I'm running out of time, but because the framework that's keeping me stable might help you too.</p>
