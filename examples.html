                            <p>In healthcare, grind mode = prescribing compliance. Experiment mode = understanding the patient's real constraints and co-designing solutions. Patients don't respond to 'should'—they respond to treatments that fit their actual lives. RAYGUN makes you curious about their barriers, not frustrated about their non-compliance.</p>
